# Housing-Data Cleaning-Project
Data Cleaning is the process of preparing and standardising data for analysis by filtering information that might not be relevant for the anaysis purposes and maximize its accuracy to better reflect what we are aiming to achieve from it. It is a vital step in Data Analysis to ensure that we are looking at the correct answers as data from several sources tends to carry mistakes which might hinder our analytical purposes. 

In this project, I have taken data on Nashville Housing and cleaned it by standardizing the date, removing duplicates, breaking out the Address into individual columns for better analysis and etc..
